## Data Analysis and Predicitive Modeling on Shopping Trends Dataset
After increasing our skill set with the previous portfolios, it was time to tackle a task of our own. This invovled me tackling the following 7 questions that I created.
1. What is the distribution of purchase amounts in different categories?
2. How does the review rating distribution differ between males and females?
3. How does the purchase amount correlate with the age of the customers?
4. Convert categorical variables (e.g., Gender, Category, Location, etc.) to numerical values.
5. Split the dataset into training and testing sets, and standardize the features.
6. Build a logistic regression model to predict the 'Subscription Status' based on other features. Report the accuracy and classification report.
7. Build a k-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifier to predict the 'Category' based on other features. Determine the optimal number of neighbors using cross-validation.
