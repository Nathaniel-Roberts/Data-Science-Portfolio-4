## Learning to Use Notebooks
In my previous programming experiences, I had never come across Jupyter Notebooks, so the initial introduction was a bit unfamiliar. I was used to traditional IDEs and programming languages, so adopting a new format included a slight learning curve. I initially hesitated to use Anaconda, preferring to set up the environment manually. Although this required some extra effort and troubleshooting, it didn't take long for me to figure out all the nuances of the system. Once I became comfortable with the interface, I began to appreciate the layout of Jupyter Notebooks. The ease with which I could write and execute code, combined with the ability to integrate markdown text for documentation, made it an enjoyable and efficient tool for both coding and learning. I soon realized the power of Jupyter Notebooks for iterative coding, data analysis, and visualization, making it a valuable asset in my programming toolkit.

## Probelm Solving Process
In my journey of learning data science within Jupyter Notebooks, I found the platform to be incredibly helpful with my problem-solving process. The iterative nature of the notebooks allowed me to approach complex data science problems step-by-step, breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable parts. I could write code to tackle a specific aspect of the problem, run it, and immediately see the results. This instant feedback loop was instrumental in refining my approach and algorithms. This hands-on approach helped me to cultivate critical thinking skills, enabling me to question assumptions, evaluate data quality, and analyse patterns in the data. I also learned the importance of understanding the business context and objectives behind the data, which informed my choice of models and algorithms. Overall, this experience has imporved my analytical skills and deepened my understanding of the problem-solving process in data science.

## Progress from Start to Finish
## Taking these Skills into the Future
Looking forward, I am excited to apply data science and Jupyter Notebooks in my current role as a Systems Engineer at Green Point Christian College, as well as in my future career in cybersecurity. In my current role, I can use data science techniques to analyse system logs, identify patterns, and optimize network performance. This can help in proactively detecting and addressing issues before they escalate. 
In the future, as I transition into cybersecurity, I hope to leverage my data science skills to analyse security logs, detect anomalies, and implement machine learning models for threat detection and prevention. My experience with Jupyter Notebooks will be invaluable in documenting and communicating my findings to non-technical stakeholders. I am excited about the opportunity to use data science as a tool to enhance security measures and contribute to creating a safer digital environment.
