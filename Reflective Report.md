## Learning to Use Notebooks
In my previous programming experiences, I had never come across Jupyter Notebooks, so the initial introduction was a bit unfamiliar. I was used to traditional IDEs and programming languages, so adopting a new format included a slight learning curve. I initially hesitated to use Anaconda, preferring to set up the environment manually. Although this required some extra effort and troubleshooting, it didn't take long for me to figure out all the nuances of the system. Once I became comfortable with the interface, I began to appreciate the layout of Jupyter Notebooks. The ease with which I could write and execute code, combined with the ability to integrate markdown text for documentation, made it an enjoyable and efficient tool for both coding and learning. I soon realized the power of Jupyter Notebooks for iterative coding, data analysis, and visualization, making it a valuable asset in my programming toolkit.

## Probelm Solving Process
In my journey of learning data science within Jupyter Notebooks, I found the platform to be incredibly helpful with my problem-solving process. The iterative nature of the notebooks allowed me to approach complex data science problems step-by-step, breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable parts. I could write code to tackle a specific aspect of the problem, run it, and immediately see the results. This instant feedback loop was instrumental in refining my approach and algorithms. This hands-on approach helped me to cultivate critical thinking skills, enabling me to question assumptions, evaluate data quality, and analyse patterns in the data. I also learned the importance of understanding the business context and objectives behind the data, which informed my choice of models and algorithms. Overall, this experience has imporved my analytical skills and deepened my understanding of the problem-solving process in data science.

## Progress from Start to Finish
At the start of the unit, I was relatively new to the concepts of data science and the practical use of tools like Jupyter Notebooks. My understanding of the subject matter was basic, and my skills in coding and data analysis were limited. However, as the unit progressed, I dedicated time to learning and practicing. I tackled the various tasks and portfolios, gradually building my confidence and competence in data science. Through consistent effort and application of the concepts learned in the unit, I can now efficiently use Jupyter Notebooks for data analysis and problem-solving. My ability to analyse data, derive insights, and communicate my findings has also significantly improved. Overall, I have come a long way from where I started, and I am proud of the progress I have made in this unit.


## Taking these Skills into the Future
Looking forward, I am excited to apply data science and Jupyter Notebooks in my current role as a Systems Engineer at Green Point Christian College, as well as in my future career in cybersecurity. In my current role, I can use data science techniques to analyse system logs, identify patterns, and optimize network performance. This can help in proactively detecting and addressing issues before they escalate. 
In the future, as I transition into cybersecurity, I hope to leverage my data science skills to analyse security logs, detect anomalies, and implement machine learning models for threat detection and prevention. My experience with Jupyter Notebooks will be invaluable in documenting and communicating my findings to non-technical stakeholders. I am excited about the opportunity to use data science as a tool to enhance security measures and contribute to creating a safer digital environment.

## Portfolio 4 Discussion Points
### Point 1 - Why did I choose the dataset that I used for my portfolio
There are several reasons on why I chose the "Shopping Trends" dataset for my portfolio::

#### Relevance to Business Questions: 
The "Shopping Trends" dataset contains features and variables that are highly relevant to common business questions, such as predicting customer behavior, understanding purchasing trends, and analysing customer satisfaction. This allowed me to demonstrate my ability to solve real-world problems.

#### Diverse Feature Set: 
The dataset includes a wide range of features, such as demographic information, product details, purchase amounts, review ratings, and more. This diversity enabled me to showcase my skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis.

#### Opportunity for Classification and Regression: 
The "Shopping Trends" data provides me the opportunity to work on both classification problems, for example, 'Subscription Status' and regression problems (e.g. predicting 'Purchase Amount'). This allowed me to demonstrate my expertise in different types of predictive modeling.

#### Practical and Ethical: 
The dataset is publicly available and does not contain sensitive information, which makes it practical and ethical to use in a portfolio project.

Overall, the "Shopping Trends" dataset offers a rich data environment that allows me to showcase my data science skills, solve interesting problems, and demonstrate value to potential employers or clients.

### Point 2 - How did I identify the problem I targeted to solve in my portfolio?
In my portfolio, I focused on solving problems related to the "Shopping Trends" dataset, which is rich in both classification and regression tasks. I aimed to address practical business questions such as predicting customer subscription status and understanding purchase categories. These problems are relevant to various industries, such as retail and e-commerce, and demonstrate the application of data science in improving customer targeting and marketing strategies. I chose problems that were challenging enough to highlight my expertise in predictive modeling, utilizing both logistic regression and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithms. The solutions not only demonstrated my technical capabilities but also highlighted my ability to derive insights and make data-driven decisions.

## Conclusion
My journey through this unit has been both challenging and rewarding. I have transformed from a novice in data science to a confident practitioner, well-versed in using Jupyter Notebooks for data analysis and problem-solving. The hands-on experience with the "Shopping Trends" dataset provided valuable insights into the practical aspects of data science, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, predictive modeling, and the derivation of insights. It allowed me to address real-world business questions and showcase my skills to potential employers or clients. As I look forward to applying these skills in my current role and future career in cybersecurity, I am excited about the potential of data science to make a positive impact and drive meaningful changes.
